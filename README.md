## Problem we are addressing
The Coronavirus pandemic is intensifying language access issues in healthcare – 
A recent investigation revealed how non-English-speaking patients with COVID-19 – can be subject to delays and miscalculations in health care facilities, in part because physicians struggle to communicate with them. 

Because many Somali patients in ICU settings do not speak proficient English and are additionally, they are without the familiar family advocates to communicate on their behalf. They are at risk of being unable to communicate medical information with hospital staff. Coronavirus makes it especially difficult to talk as breathing becomes more stressed and the patient may be intubated and unable to speak. 

Lack of the ability to communicate puts patients at greater risk of receiving poorer treatment, which supports the pressuring need to implement and use AAC (Augmented Alternative Control) in critical care. Improving communication strategies may improve patient safety and make a difference in patient outcomes.

## Our Solution 

We've created AAC (Augmented Alternative Control) screens that can be used by Somalis in ICU (intensive care unit) settings, to communicate important information with medical personnel. The screens are focused on solving some specific form of communication, such as “needs”, “wants”, “medical questions”, “pain assessment”. 

The application is available on web, Android & iOS.
